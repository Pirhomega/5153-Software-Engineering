	C. Bottom: Datebase
4. Deliverables
	A. Proposed 10-day sprints
	B. Acknowledged delivery date to be 53 days from now
5. How should we do the first sprint?

	B. Create categories for products
	C. We're using Trello to track progress and tasks
6. Lowered priorities of difficult requirements (adding descriptions and images to products)
